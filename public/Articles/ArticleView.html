                  <summary> What are Dreams ? </summary>
                  <p>Dreams are stories and images that our minds create while we sleep. They can be entertaining, fun, romantic, disturbing, frightening, and sometimes bizarre.
                    They are an enduring source of mystery for scientists and psychological doctors. Why do dreams occur? What causes them? Can we control them? What do they mean? </p>

                  <summary> Why are dreams significant ? </summary>
                  <p>From a scientific paradigm, dreams evolved to ensure that the part of the brain that handles vision(i.e The visual cortex or Occipital lobe) does not deprecate while we sleep(basically
                     keep it alive) This is usually to ensure that your brain can adequately proccess what you see.
                    From an evolutionary perspective, dreams worked as a virtual environment to the cave man in order to simulate dangerous situations that might arise in the wild .
                    From a spiritual perspective , dreams happen to prepare us of future events and has made its way to some gospel writings as an insight of whats to come.
                    I wont give you a definitive answer as to why they happen </p>

                  <summary> What causes them </summary>
                  <p>The simple answer is that our brains cause them, here's why . In my view dreams can be an expression of our suppressed desires. Your brain goes through sort of an
                     autopilot mode where it can generate images based on our thoughts. They  mostly happen in scenes we've experienced, coupled with our deepest imaginations. We can 
                     therefore conclude that our dreams are caused by a function of our thoughts, emotions and surrounding(Including but not limited to inanimate objects) </p>

                  <summary> Can we control our dreams </summary>
                  <p>Controling your dreams can be a daunting yet satisfying trial, here's why. While some say it would be trivial to do so, I think a good dream can be a prequel to an
                     awesome day. They tend to have an influence on how we socialize. Humans having the capability of being self aware, can control our thoughts, as I had mentioned earlier
                      dreams can be caused by our thoughts. Thinking about something for prolonged  periods increases the chance of that thought (or something related to it) appearing in 
                      our dreams. A good dream could literally be one thought away.</p>

                  <summary> Do dreams have an intrinsic meaning </summary>
                  <p>Various sources, including the Bible do incite that dreams posses deeper meaning. According to me the human brain posseses power that beyond which we can understand. Our subconcious
                     mind basically picks up relevant information from our surrounding and through dreams it feeds its analysis and output to the concious mind and therefore we can remember them as we 
                     would the events of the day.  </p>
