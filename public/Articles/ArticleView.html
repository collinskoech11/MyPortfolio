                  <summary> What are Dreams ? </summary>
                  <p>Dreams are stories and images that our minds create while we sleep. They can be entertaining, fun, romantic, disturbing, frightening, and sometimes bizarre.
                    They are an enduring source of mystery for scientists and psychological doctors. Why do dreams occur? What causes them? Can we control them? What do they mean? </p>

                  <summary> How do we dream ? </summary>
                  <p>There are a number of phases that our brains go through in cycles throughout the night. In the first phase we <a href="#"> Transition</a> from wakefullness to 
                    sleep as we begin to relax and breathing slows . And now into <a href="#">Light Sleep</a> as body temperature drops ad breathing slows down even more . After that 
                    comes <a href="#">Deep sleep</a> characterized by a particular pattern in your brain called delta waves . Finally comes the <a href="#"> REM sleep</a> Breathing gets 
                    faster, and your eye moves all over. During this stage is when dreaming happens . Through this phase the brain is active almost as active as how it is during the day </p>

                  <summary> Why are dreams significant ? </summary>
                  <p>From a scientific paradigm, dreams evolved to ensure that the part of the brain that handles vision(i.e The visual cortex or Occipital lobe) does not deprecate while we sleep(basically
                     keep it alive) This is usually to ensure that your brain can adequately proccess what you see.
                    From an evolutionary perspective, dreams worked as a virtual environment to the cave man in order to simulate dangerous situations that might arise in the wild .
                    From a spiritual perspective , dreams happen to prepare us of future events and has made its way to some gospel writings as an insight of whats to come.
                    I wont give you a definitive answer as to why they happen </p>

                  <summary> What causes them </summary>
                  <p>The simple answer is that our brains cause them, here's why . In my view dreams can be an expression of our suppressed desires,, In his book <a href="#">Interpretation of dreams</a> 
                    Sigmund Freud states that dreams could be used to understand unconcious desires . It all started when he ad a dream famously called <a href="#">Irma's Injection</a> 
                    When dreaming your brain goes through sort of an autopilot mode where it can generate images based on our thoughts. They  mostly happen in scenes we've experienced, 
                    coupled with our deepest imaginations. We can therefore conclude that our dreams are caused by a function of our thoughts, emotions and surrounding(Including but not limited to inanimate objects) </p>

                      <summary> Activation Synthesis Theory</summary>
                      <p> The activation-synthesis model suggests that dreams are caused by the physiological processes of the brain. While people used to believe that sleeping and dreaming was a passive process, researchers now know that the brain is anything but quiet during sleep.

                  <summary> Can we control our dreams </summary>
                  <p>Controling your dreams can be a daunting yet satisfying trial, here's why. While some say it would be trivial to do so, I think a good dream can be a prequel to an
                     awesome day. They tend to have an influence on how we socialize. Humans having the capability of being self aware, can control our thoughts, as I had mentioned earlier
                      dreams can be caused by our thoughts. Thinking about something for prolonged  periods increases the chance of that thought (or something related to it) appearing in 
                      our dreams. A good dream could literally be one thought away.</p>

                  <summary> Do dreams have an intrinsic meaning </summary>
                  <p>Various sources, including the Bible do incite that dreams posses deeper meaning. According to me the human brain posseses power that beyond which we can understand. Our subconcious
                     mind basically picks up relevant information from our surrounding and through dreams it feeds its analysis and output to the concious mind and therefore we can remember them as we 
                     would the events of the day. Ancient Egyptians kept a record of common dreams and their supposed meanings that help professional dream interprators use to help decode peoples dreams  </p>

                      <p>A sarcophagus most often symbolizes oblivion and lost illusions in a dream. Why else is this rare and unusual image seen in dreams? Dream books offer several interpretations depending on the most striking details.

                  <summary> Scientific Discoveries made while dreaming </summary>
                  <p>German scientist August Kekule(Chemistry proffesor - GHENT UNIVERSITY) in the year 1862 discovered the chemical structure of Benzene in a dream, a discovery that would later transform 
                    the field of Organic chemistry. The fascinating thing about benzene is that unlike other hydrocarbons which have more hydrogen atoms tan carbon atoms, Benzene has an equal number of hydrogen
                     and carbon atoms in its structure . In his dream he saw vissions of atoms and mollecules float around - suddenly the atoms and mollecules turn into a series of six snakes and suddenly one coils 
                     around and eats its own tail. In turn mimicingthe atomic structure of benzene . </p>
